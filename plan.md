# Dashboard Deep Polish Follow-up Plan

Progress: 100%

- 100% – Capture baseline desktop and mobile screenshots, confirm sidebar overlap on mobile, and log polish targets (hero stacking, spacing, card depth, progress indicators).
- 100% – Rework responsive layout for hero + sidebar (stacking, padding, visibility) and smooth typography scaling on small screens.
- 100% – Refresh metric and dataset card styling for clarity (progress bar rendering, contrast, content alignment tweaks).
- 100% – Re-test across breakpoints, capture updated desktop/mobile screenshots, and finalise summary once visuals look correct.
